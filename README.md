FSD-CLCD: Functional Semantic Distillation Graph Learning for Cross-Language Code Clone Detection

The _saved_model_ folder is used to save the trained model. Currently, there is a trained model with a pruning ratio of 0.4.

The _saved_var_ folder is used to store preprocessed dataset variables, thereby reducing the time spent repeatedly processing the dataset. Due to the size limit of GitHub, we have only stored test data here.

The _log_ folder is used to save the logs generated during the runtime process.

The code for data preprocessing is currently not publicly available. If needed, please contact us by Flsrage@gmail.com

To get the result in paper, run _main.py_
